# What?

Use this to work offline with git.

When you have no internet connection, you can't `git push`. That's why I created `pushlater`. Call `pushlater` with the same arguments as `git push`. When you have internet, call `pushlater --now` and your repos will be pushed. In case the git push fails for some reason, you will be notified.
